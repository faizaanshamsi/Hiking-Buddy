Coding Challenge

Part 1: 

Your task is to build an app in Ember with the following requirements:

  1. The application should have a Rails backend and an Ember frontend using Ember CLI
  
  2. The app should have at least one model with working index, show, new, and edit pages. Optional: Add a second related model
  
  3. Don't add Authentication and Authorization.
  
  4. The backend should use `JSONAPI::Resources` (https://github.com/cerebris/jsonapi-resources) for the API. This follows the spec on jsonapi.org that Ember uses by default. If you're not sure about the Serializers/Adapters, feel free to reach out. 
  
  5. Tests aren't necessary for the frontend. Feel free to add what tests you find useful for the backend.

  6.  Use version 2.x+ for Ember, Ember CLI, and Ember Data. When you generate a new app using Ember CLI you may need to change some versions. Reach out to us for help or follow instruction at http://www.ember-cli.com/user-guide/#upgrading.

Part 2:

Upon successful completion of the the first part, we'll invite you in for an person interview. We're not going to whiteboard or ask you puzzle questions, we'll pair with you on the app you just built. The goal will be to talk through what you've built so far and add a small feature.



Tips and Resources:

- If you have any questions, **reach out to us on the Slack channel** you've been invited to. Ember is changing fast so many of the online resources are out of date.

- An example Rails/Ember-CLI app is available at https://github.com/vikram7/english-hindi. The setup section of the [masterminder](https://github.com/hchood/masterminder/blob/master/project_notes.md) project_notes contains instructions for directory structure since there will be a Rails and Ember app in a single directory. It's important to note that these are older apps that have some deprecations so not everything will be identical.

- http://www.programwitherik.com/ember-mirage-tutorial-and-examples/ is a useful tutorial. It uses a mock server instead of Rails but should be helpful with some of the Ember concepts.

- https://leanpub.com/ember-cli-101 and Rock 'n Roll with Ember.js are good books as well. 

- The [Ember Inspector](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ember-inspector/bmdblncegkenkacieihfhpjfppoconhi) will help with debugging

Good luck!
